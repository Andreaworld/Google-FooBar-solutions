Imagine you are the shooter, and you are looking around the room. The most obvious first shot is directly at the 
trainer, and you can tell that because, well, you are looking directly at him without anything blocking your way.

Now imagine, the walls are mirrors. When you look at the mirrors, you see millions of your own reflections, and 
millions of the trainer. At some angles though when you look at one of the mirrors, it looks like you are looking
directly at the trainer. You are looking directly at their reflection. The same logic for the direct shot applies
here. When you look directly at one of the trainer's reflections, without anything between the reflection and you
(whether in the real world or in "the mirror world"), that is also another path to shoot the trainer.

The approach I have implemented is supposed to exploit this fact. Pretend that the mirror world is real and exists
in 3d (well, 2d in this case, but anyway) space. All the program needs to do, is just find all the mirror world
trainers, check if they are within maximum distance, and finally nothing is blocking the shot between you and the
trainer, whether that is another mirror world trainer or a mirror world you.
